This was done to make all field operations visible to every manager, which had many activities. Goal was to see activity stats and find reasons of order delays at manager’s end. In addition, information about causes of delays was required so they could minimize them and, ultimately, avoid delays altogether.","solution":"The entire script of the data was written and the previous data was preserved.  \r\nFor script, SQL was used instead of Python or JavaScript to improve speed efficiency whereas Python and JavaScript were used for building the dashboards. Docker machines were used as virtual machines hosted on GCP. The team developed a CI/CD pipeline which could be triggered by a single button click for deployment of latest code.","tech":"Python Django, JavaScript, SQL,  Jenkins, Docker","services":"Data Integration, Dashboard Design and Development, Business Intelligence, Data Visualization, User Management, Cloud Computing, Project Management","architecture":"Docker","industry":"Telecommunications","timeline":"8 Months","website":"https://www.singtel.com","views":18,"rating":"5","creation_date":"2023-05-04","edited_date":"2023-08-05","author":"Huda Sohail","thumbnail":"https://api.pos.coaldev.com/media/media/Singtel_Field_Operations_Application.jpg","status":false,"tag":[{"id":5,"tag_name":"Custom Web Development"}]}]}},"__N_SSG":true}
