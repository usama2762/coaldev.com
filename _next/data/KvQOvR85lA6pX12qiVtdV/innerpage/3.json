Human developments and innovations have been changing the world since centuries. From spinning wheels to computers and then to smart phones, innovation has been the only constant. Workplaces are now constantly looking for ways to make work more easy, accessible, and favorable for employees. The paradigm is shifting towards working remotely, from the comfort of your home. Here are some of the reasons why companies are increasingly opting for work-form-home:","content":"Environment Friendly: \r\n\r\nRemote working has proved to be more environmentally friendly due to a reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, reduction in consumption of fossil fuels, better air quality and reduction in usage of paper. As global warming and environmental degradation have become a great cause of concern, working from home seems a plausible and sustainable solution to protect our environment. Apart from that, according to a study, employees tend to conserve energy more when they work from home since in offices they have no financial incentive to save energy. However, at home, saving energy by turning off lights means saving money and hence they are more inclined to conserve energy. \r\n\r\nIncreased Productivity: \r\n\r\nWorking from home has also proved to increase productivity. A study by Stanford University of 16,000 workers over 9 months found that working from home resulted in increased productivity by 13%. Moreover, according to another study, 85% of global companies saw an increase in work productivity after offering workplace flexibility options. The primary reason is more control over the work environment which allows employees to focus more on their work and perform better. Retention rate has also proved to increase after giving the option of working from home for many companies. In fact, 84% of Canadian businesses offering home-office options said that it helped them attract and retain talented employees due to the ease and flexibility offered by remote work. \r\n\r\nConvenience: \r\n\r\nRemote work also causes convenience for many employees. The irritation of getting stuck in traffic and the constant stress of making it on time for an important meeting are all absent when it comes to working from home. Needless to say, that makes the life of all workers relatively stress-free. The convenience also helps employees focus more on their work and save time which is otherwise lost in travelling. This helps in achieving a work-life balance which again positively impacts the productivity of all employees. \r\n\r\nAll in all, it would not be wrong to say that indeed, remote offices are the best fit for the future. The convenience and benefits associated with work-from-home is what exactly we need these days.
